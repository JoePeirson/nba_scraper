# nba_scraper

### Introduction
In this project I looked at a simple web scraper which collects data from the play by play commentary on espn.com for NBA games.

### Tools used
This programming language used to build this was Python. The main libraires I used were Pandas and Selenium.

### How this tool can be used
This is a very simplified scraper that can be used to analyse a players actions for each match. The data is formatted in a way one can look a players specific shots from a certain location, distance, type of shots and time in the match.
